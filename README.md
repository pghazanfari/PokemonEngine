# Pokemon Engine
A Pokemon game engine written in C# following a pseudo-MVC design pattern.
## Goals
* Create a working Pokemon game engine that can be used to create Pokemon fan games
* Use MVC design principles to minimize code coupling and reduce the complexity of the code
* Provide enough abstraction for developers to make significant changes without the need to modify base game model
## About
This goal of this project is to create a working Pokemon game engine that can be used to create Pokemon fan games. The project is written in C# and will be following MVC design principles except for situations in which this would needlessly increase the complexity of the code. The Graphics Engine will also be written in C# and will use the [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) platform.

***This project is still in its early phases and, therefore, may undergo radical changes before release***
